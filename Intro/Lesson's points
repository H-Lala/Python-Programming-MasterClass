It's first day that I try

Today's some points from lessons

- literal
- function
- argument
- calling a function
- return value
- parameter

# in Python there is no difference single quotes and double quotes


functions which I used
- print
- input

Escape char
- \n
- \t
- triple quotes

If you want \ in the strings
# you have to use \\
or
# use r in front of string
